          Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas, and is the second-largest contributor to climate warming after
          carbon dioxide (CO2). A molecule of methane traps more heat than a molecule of CO2, but methane has a
          relatively short lifespan of 7 to 12 years in the atmosphere, while CO2 can persist for hundreds of years or
          more.<br>
          Methane emissions provided as fluxes, in units of molecules of methane per square cm per second, for over 25
          individual emission source categories, including those from agriculture, petroleum and natural gas systems,
          coal mining, and waste. The data have been converted from their original NetCDF format to Cloud-Optimized
          GeoTIFF (COG) and scaled to Megagrams of CH‚ÇÑ per km¬≤ per year (Mg/km¬≤/yr) for use in the US GHG Center,
          thereby enabling user exploration of spatial anthropogenic methane emissions and their trends.

        <p><span class="ab">What is Source of Methane?<br></span>
          The largest sources of methane are agriculture, fossil fuels, and decomposition of landfill waste. Natural
          processes account for 40% of methane emissions, with wetlands being the largest natural source.

        <p><span class="ab">Is methane essential?<br></span>
          Methane is not essential for life but is important for energy production, industrial processes, and
          contributing to the carbon cycle. While it has significant uses, its environmental impact as a greenhouse gas
          is a growing concern.</p>

        <p><span class="ab">Impacts of Methane<br></span>
          Methane impacts the environment as a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming and air pollution
          through ground-level ozone formation. Economically, it's vital for energy production and job creation but
          poses challenges in agriculture due to livestock emissions. Additionally, melting permafrost releases more
          methane, accelerating climate change. Managing methane emissions is essential to balance its benefits and
          mitigate its negative effects on health and the environment.</p>

        <p><span class="ab">Effects of Methane<br></span>
          Methane significantly effects the environment and health by contributing to global warming as a potent
          greenhouse gas. It leads to ground-level ozone formation, which harms air quality and public health. In
          agriculture, livestock emissions affect sustainability. Additionally, melting permafrost releases more
          methane, worsening climate change. While it supports energy production, managing methane emissions is crucial
          to mitigate its negative effects.</p>

        <p><span class="ab">Causes of Methane<br></span>
          Methane emissions come from several sources, including livestock digestion and manure management in
          agriculture, decomposition of organic waste in landfills, leaks during natural gas extraction and
          distribution, natural processes in wetlands, and anaerobic conditions in flooded rice fields. The
          concentration of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled over the past 200 years. Scientists estimate
          that this increase is responsible for 20 to 30% of climate warming since the Industrial Revolution </p>

        <p><span class="ab">Dataset of CH<sub>4</sub><br></span>
          Here are some sources for methane (CH‚ÇÑ) datasets:
          NASA added the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument to the International Space
          Station in 2022. Though built principally to study dust storms and sources, researchers found that it could
          also detect large methane sources, known as ‚Äúsuper-emitters.‚Äù

        <p><span class="ab">Solution of CH<sub>4</sub><br></span>
          Solutions to address methane (CH‚ÇÑ) emissions focus on a range of strategies aimed at reduction and capture.
          Implementing technologies to capture methane from landfills and wastewater treatment plants can significantly
          lower atmospheric emissions. In agriculture, improving livestock management and manure handling helps reduce
          emissions. Upgrading natural gas infrastructure to minimize leaks during extraction and transport is also
          crucial. Restoring wetlands can enhance carbon sequestration while reducing emissions, and employing water
          management techniques in rice cultivation can lower methane production. </p>
