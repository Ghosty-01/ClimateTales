            <h1>Nasa Resourses on Carbon Dioxide</h1>
            <p>NASA's research satellites are studying how carbon moves around the planet.

                NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, or OCO-2, launched in 2014 to measure CO2 to better observe
                Earth's carbon cycle. OCO-2 investigates important questions about carbon dioxide on Earth all the way
                from space! NASA's OCO-2 also helps explore how measurements from space can predict future CO2 increases
                and its impact on Earth's climate.<br>
                Since the onset of industrial times in the 18th century, human activities have raised atmospheric CO2 by
                50% – meaning the amount of CO2 is now 150% of its value in 1750. This human-induced rise is greater
                than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago.

            <p>This graph showing the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 800,000 years. The
                x-axis represents time in years before today, with 0 representing 1950. The y-axis represents the
                concentration of carbon dioxide in parts per million (ppm).

                The graph shows a clear trend of increasing carbon dioxide levels over the past 800,000 years. For most
                of that period, the concentration remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 180 and 280 ppm.
                However, in the past 100 years, the concentration has increased dramatically, reaching a current level
                of around 420 ppm.

                The graph also highlights the significance of the year 1950. This is the year when the concentration of
                carbon dioxide began to exceed 360 ppm, a level that had not been reached in millions of years. This
                increase is largely attributed to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and
                deforestation. <br>
