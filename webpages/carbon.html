        <p><span class="ab">What is carbon Dioxide?<br></span>
          Carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouses gases on the earth, which traps heats close to earth. It
          helps earth hold some of the heat it receives from the sun so it doesn't all escape back into space. But CO2
          is only good up to a point beyond that point, earth's temperature warms up too much. Human activities, such as
          burning fossil fuels and cutting down forest and changing the balance between how much carbon is in the air
          and how much carbon is stored in plants and ocean. It is the main gas contributing to climate change. Human
          activities hav raised the atmosphere's carbon dioxide content by 50% in less than 2000.

        <p><span class="ab">Is carbon dioxide essential?<br></span>
          Carbon Dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> an essential component of the Earth's ecosystem, playing a crucial role in
          various biological, geological, and atmospheric processes. While Excessive levels of CO<sub>2</sub>can have
          negative impacts, itis essential in moderate amounts for several reasons. If it weren't for this greenhouse
          effect, Earth's ocean would be frozen solid. If not for the greenhouse effect, Earth would be an ice ball!
          Earth would not be the beautiful blue and green planet of¬†life¬†that¬†it¬†is. CO2 is so good at holding in heat
          from the Sun that even a small increase in CO2 in the atmosphere can make Earth¬†even¬†warmer. </p>

        <p><span class="ab">What is Sources of carbon dioxide?<br></span>
          Carbon Dioxide comes from both CO<sub>2</sub> comes from both natural and human sources. Natural sources
          include the respiration and decomposition of organisms, weathering of carbonate rocks, forest fires, volcanic
          eruptions, and the release of CO2 from the ocean. Human sourcesof CO2 emissions come from activities like
          cement production, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.

          Carbon dioxide has several impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy. Some of the most
          significant effects include:<br>
          Environmental impacts such as global warming and climate change, Ocean Acidification, extreme weather event;
          <br>Human Health Impacts such as Respiratory problems, heat-related illness, mental health.</p>

          Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions primarily result from human activities, significantly contributing to climate
          change. major causes are Fossil Fuel Combustion, Industrial Processes, Deforestation and Land Use Change,
          Agriculture, Waste Management, Heating, Natural Processes and Energy Inefficiency </p>

          Here are some sources for Carbon (CO‚ÇÑ) datasets:
          NASA added the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument to the International Space
          Station in 2022. Though built principally to study dust storms and sources, researchers found that it could
          also detect large methane sources, known as ‚Äúsuper-emitters.‚Äù
