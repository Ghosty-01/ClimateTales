            <h1>Nasa Resourses on Methane</h1>
            <p>NASA's research satellites are studying how carbon moves around the planet.

                Methane (CH₄) emissions from vegetated wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of
                methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and
                anthropogenic emissions.<br>

            </p>
            <img src="methane data.png" alt="">
            <p>The graph shows the concentration of methane (CH4) in the Earth's atmosphere over time. The data spans
                from the late 1700s to 2020. The y-axis represents the CH4 concentration in parts per billion (ppb),
                while the x-axis represents the year.<br>

                Steadily increasing CH4 levels: The most striking feature of the graph is the consistent upward trend in
                CH4 concentrations. This indicates that the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing
                over the past two centuries.<br>
                Annual fluctuations: While there is a general upward trend, the graph also shows year-to-year
                fluctuations in CH4 levels. These fluctuations are primarily due to natural processes such as emissions
                from wetlands and agriculture.<br>
                Rapid rise since the Industrial Revolution: The overall trend of increasing CH4 levels is closely linked
                to the Industrial Revolution. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, and
                waste disposal have released large amounts of CH4 into the atmosphere, contributing to the observed
                increase.<br>
                Implications of rising CH4 levels:

                Climate change: CH4 is a potent greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The
                increasing concentration of CH4 is a major contributor to global warming and climate change.<br>
                Air quality: CH4 is also a pollutant that can have negative effects on air quality.<br>
                Ozone depletion: CH4 can contribute to the breakdown of ozone in the stratosphere, which protects the
                Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation.<br>
                Overall, the graph provides compelling evidence of the significant increase in atmospheric CH4 levels in
                recent decades. This increase is primarily due to human activities and has serious implications for the
                planet's climate and environment.
